        <h2>Chicken legs include the drumstick and thigh. When the two chicken pieces are left together, they're often called a leg quarter and sometimes a hindquarter, though some people use leg when referring to the drumstick alone.</h2>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups low fat sour cream
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced
            <li>6 chicken drumsticks
            <li>6 bone-in chicken breast halves, with skin
            <li>4 cups crushed cornflakes cereal
            <li>4 tablespoons crushed dried rosemary
            <li>3 teaspoons dried sage
            <li>3 tablespoons garlic powder
            <li>salt and pepper to taste
            
            </ul>

            <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a cooling rack on top of a large cookie sheet. Spray the rack with vegetable cooking spray.
