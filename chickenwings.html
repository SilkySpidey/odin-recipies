        <h1>Chicken Wing Recipie</h1>

        <img src="images/chickenwing.jpg" alt="A plate full of chicken wings">

        <h2>There are three types of wings you'll find at the market: the whole wing, the flat, and the drumette (the latter being the part that looks like a mini-drumstick). When you see these two parts together, it's easy to imagine the wing of a bird.</h2>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil
            <li>3 cloves garlic, pressed
            <li>2 teaspoons chili powder
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste
            <li>10 chicken wings

        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <ol>

        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        <li>Combine the olive oil, garlic, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a large, resealable bag; seal and shake to combine. Add the chicken wings; reseal and shake to coat. Arrange the chicken wings on a baking sheet.
        <li>Cook the wings in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until crisp and cooked through.
        
        </ol>
